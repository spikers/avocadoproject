# Project Avocado
This is a PHP sample project I built, it interfaces with a MySQL server (PHP MyAdmin).

## What is Project Avocado
Have you ever wondered: What's the main ingredient for curry? Or for guacamole? Well, Project Avocado is here for you. It tells you the ONE main ingredient in every user-submitted item (be it food or otherwise). So for Curry: Coconut Milk. Guacamole: Avocado. Cranberry Juice: Sugar.
